h4. News apps template

Clone this repository and run:

pre. python setup.py install

It will install PasteScript, Cheetah and Fabric. So you may want to create a new virtualenv.

Once installed, run:

pre. paster create --template=newsapps_project example_project

The newsapps_project template is very similar to django_project. Major differences include: 
* A much larger "fabric deployment script with a bunch of goodies":http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2010/02/10/refactoring-fabric/
* Removed and refactored config directories. There are now dirs for production, staging and common.
* Tightly integrated with Chicago Tribune's "News apps Amazon EC2 Image":http://blog.apps.chicagotribune.com/2010/02/17/our-geodjango-amazon-ec2-image-for-news-apps/ (ami-ff17fb96 on us-east)
* Removed CruiseControl stuff.
* Added a 'manage' script in the project root to make management commands accessible.

h4. Django-project-templates

This project contains templates for creating a new Django project. It's like running django-admin.py startproject but it creates a more complete application skeleton.

All you need to do is install the package from PyPi like so:

pre. python easy_install django-project-templates

And then creating a project skeleton is as simple as:

pre. paster create --template=django_project example_project

For bonus points you should probably be running this inside a virtualenv.

Note that this project skeleton is still in flux. It definitely contains some things that are personal preference but it hopefully makes up for it with useful tools like a reasonably complete fabric based deployment setup and configs for CruiseControl. And yes, more documentation would be nice.
