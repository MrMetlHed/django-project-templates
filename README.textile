This project currently contains one template for creating a new Django project. It's like running django-admin.py startproject but it creates a
more complete application skeleton.

All you need to do is install the package from PyPi like so:

pre. python easy_install django-project-templates

And then creating a project skeleton is as simple as:

pre. paster create --template=newsapps_project example_project

For bonus points you should probably be running this inside a virtualenv.

Note that this project skeleton is still in flux. It definitely contains some things that are personal preference but it hopefully makes up for it with useful tools like a reasonably complete fabric based deployment setup and configs for CruiseControl. And yes, more documentation would be nice.
